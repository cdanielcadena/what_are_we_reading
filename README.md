# what are we reading?

Keeping up with the scientific literature is hard even with ever increasing access to information via social media and the internet. So we in the [lab](https://evolvert.uniandes.edu.co/), partly inspired by this blog [post](https://haroldpimentel.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/leaderboard/), decided to create a repository to share papers we've been reading lately. Not sure how will this progress, but here's a start to motivate people to (1) start thinking about how to do this and make it most useful, and (2) contribute. For now, IÂ´ll just post papers and links by date in which I read them.
