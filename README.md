# what are we reading?

Keeping track of the scientific literature is hard even with ever increasing access to information via social media and the internet. So we in the [lab](https://evolvert.uniandes.edu.co/) decided to create a repository to share papers we've been reading lately. Not sure how will this progress, but here's a start to motivate people to (1) start thinking about how to do this and (2) make it most useful and contribute.

I (Daniel) read two papers today (Feb 14):

- [Phylogenomic analysis of trichomycterid catfishes (Teleostei: Siluriformes) inferred from ultraconserved elements](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59519-w)

- [Tropical snake diversity collapses after widespread amphibian loss](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6479/814)
